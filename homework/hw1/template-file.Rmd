Your task here is to convert this `.Rmd` document into a `.html` file.
To do so, you will need to install **R** and `RStudio`.
The [R4DS Book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites) has good instructions.

1. To download R, go to CRAN, the comprehensive R archive network. CRAN is composed of a set of mirror servers distributed around the world and is used to distribute R and R packages. Don’t try and pick a mirror that’s close to you: instead use the cloud mirror, https://cloud.r-project.org, which automatically figures it out for you.
2. RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. Download and install it from http://www.rstudio.com/download. RStudio is updated a couple of times a year. When a new version is available, RStudio will let you know. It’s a good idea to upgrade regularly so you can take advantage of the latest and greatest features. For this course, make sure you have RStudio 1.0.0 or higher.

Next you need to install a few packages.
Run

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('ggthemes')
install.packages('viridis')
```

Please edit this file to include your name and your UNI in the `author` block at the top of this page.
Finally

```{r knitr_init, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
# DO NOT edit this block
library(knitr)
library(rmdformats)
opts_chunk$set(
  echo=TRUE,
  cache=TRUE,
  prompt=FALSE,
  tidy=TRUE,
  comment=NA,
  message=FALSE,
  warning=FALSE,
  fig.width=12,
  fig.height=7
)
```

Load in `tidyverse`

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
require(viridis)
```

Get the `mtcars` data=

```{r}
data(mtcars)
mtcars %>% glimpse()
```

Make a plot of the data

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=disp)) +
  scale_color_viridis() +
  facet_wrap('cyl') +
  labs(x = "Car Horsepower", 
       y = "Car Miles per Gallon",
       color = "Disp",
       title = "Car Horsepower and MPG for 3 Engine Configurations")
```
