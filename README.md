## Course Overview

Sensors, satellites, cell phones, and manual recordings provide large quantities of data about the climate, water, natural resources, ecology, and human behavior.
In this class we will focus on analyzing and modeling such data sets with a focus on space and time variations, and potential inter-relations between variables.
You should take this class if you would like to learn:

- How to think about statistical data and their analysis in the context of typical environmental problems
- Key techniques in statistical modeling and machine learning, their underlying ideas and  applicability, and how to use them
- Building, selecting, and checking statistical models in an applied, computational context

## Pre-Requisites

The **pre-requisites** for this course are a first course in probability and statistics, a course in linear algebra, and some experience writing simple programming scripts.
If you are missing one or more of these pre-requisites but would still like to take the class, please contact us.
You should anticipate additional work in this case.
We will provide a Homework 0 before the first class date to allow you to evaluate your background.

## Grading

| Assignment    | Points |
|---------------|--------|
| Homeworks     | 49     |
| Final Exam    | 21     |
| Final Project | 30     |


All assignments will be collected on Courseworks.

Computational assignments are to be written as executable [`Rmarkdown`](rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files which contain blocks of code, text, and code output (i.e. graphics) in a single document.
Please turn in the `.Rmd` file and the `.html` output file that it generates.

Any assignment which does not require computation should be turned in as a `.pdf` file, which may be written on the computer or by hand and scanned.
Printed homeworks will __not__ be accepted.

Homeworks turned in late will receive a penalty of 10% for each day late.

## Final Project

This will be updated later.

## Final Exam

Will be a take-home exam.

## Honesty Policy

## Textbooks and References

We will not follow a single textbook, but will draw material from a variety of sources.
All are freely available online.

- R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, available free online at [the author's website](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) covers all things **R**
- Data Science: R Basics [free edX course](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics-harvardx-ph125-1x-0). It is highly encouraged that work through this course, as there will be a homework drawing heavily from it.
- Grinstead and Snell's [Introduction to Probability](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/251/readings/ProbabilityBook_GrinsteadSnell.pdf), and in particular chapters 1, 2, 5, 6
- Zico Kolter's [Linear Algebra Review and Reference](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) is an excellent reference for those who have had some exposure but need to review core concepts
- An Introduction to Statistical Learning, by James et al (2013) is available for free through the Columbia library.
