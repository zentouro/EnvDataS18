### Course Communication

Course files will be posted on the course `GitHub` page.
All class communication will be conducted through the Slack channel.
Please read [this article](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/slack-goes-to-college-how-it-can-improve-the-classroom-experience/) to learn why we are using Slack for communication.
While the direct (private) messages are a great feature, please try to ask questions about course content in a public thread so that others can view and comment.

## Assignments

Assignments will be detailed more.

Assignments will use the **R** programming language.
We do not expect that you have used **R** before, but if you have not done any simple programming in the past you should be expected to do some extra work in the first weeks of the semester to catch up.

Computational assignments are to be written as executable [`Rmarkdown`](rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files which contain blocks of code, text, and code output (i.e. graphics) in a single document.
Please turn in the `.Rmd` file and the `.html` output file that it generates.
## Textbooks

In this course we will not use any single textbook exhaustively, but will draw from the following textbooks.
Readings will be announced on the syllabus and in class.

- Your first reference for anything related to programming, visualizing, or working with data in the R language is the R for Data Science book, available free online at [the author's website](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).  Reference this book for questions about reading data into R, using `Rmarkdown`, filtering and cleaning data, plotting data, dealing with dates, or dealing with strings.
- The book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7) is also available for free and is worth downloading. This book is focused on machine learning (which has not been clearly separated from the field of statistics) and has detailed mathematical information on many common machine learning algorithms. If you are interested in a particular topic or procedure, you should look it up here.

The following textbooks may be useful in your life and may be useful in small doses, but will not be required reading.

- Richard McElreath's [Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) is an excellent introduction course in Bayesian Data Analysis and statistical thinking in general. It is, however, designed to be a course so you'll want to start from the beginning.
